# Arduino-Based Self-Driving Car Project ðŸš—
This project is a small step into the world of autonomous vehicles. Using an Arduino microcontroller, weâ€™ve built a simple car with two motors in the back for movement and two front wheels that steer using a servo motor. The goal of this project is to explore how sensors and coding can make a car respond to its environment, much like real-world autonomous cars.

The hardware was provided by ZF Friedrichshafen in Timisoara

The car is equipped with 2 infrared (IR) sensors to follow lines on the ground, 3 distance sensors to detect obstacles, and a servo to steer left, right, or go straight. It can perform basic functions like maintaining a set distance from another car, avoiding obstacles, following a predefined path, and even parking sideways. While this is far from the complexity of something like Teslaâ€™s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system, it introduces some of the basic ideas behind how self-driving cars work.

This project is about learning and experimenting with technology. By building and coding this car, you can get hands-on experience with concepts like sensor integration, motor control, and basic decision-making for robots. Itâ€™s a fun way to understand the basics of autonomous driving while working on a creative and challenging project!

This project uses a MIT license, meaning it's open source and you can use it however you like.
